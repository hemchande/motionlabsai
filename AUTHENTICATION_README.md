### 2. Role-Based Dashboards

#### Coach Dashboard
- **Athlete Roster**: View and manage all athletes under the coach
- **All Sessions**: Access to all athlete training sessions
- **Statistics Overview**: 
  - Total athletes count
  - Total sessions count
  - Average Motion IQ across all athletes
  - Recent sessions this week
- **Search & Filter**: Filter athletes by level, search sessions by event
- **Athlete Management**: Add new athletes, view individual athlete progress

#### Athlete Dashboard
- **Personal Sessions**: View only their own training sessions
- **Performance Overview**: 
  - Personal session count
  - Average Motion IQ
  - Best performing event
  - Average improvement percentage
- **Coach Feedback**: View coach notes and feedback for each session
- **Performance Analytics**: Track progress across all events
- **Session Details**: View highlights and areas for improvement

### 3. User Management

#### User Types
- **Coach**: Can manage multiple athletes, view all sessions, upload videos
- **Athlete**: Can view only their own sessions and performance data

#### User Data Structure
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  fullName: string;
  role: "coach" | "athlete";
  institution?: string;        // Coach only
  athleteCount?: number;       // Coach only
  createdAt: string;
  lastLogin: string;
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- **State Management**: Centralized authentication state
- **Mock Database**: In-memory user storage for demonstration
- **API Simulation**: Async operations with loading states
- **Session Persistence**: localStorage for maintaining login state

### 2. Authentication Screen (`AuthScreen.tsx`)
- **Dual Mode**: Login and signup in single component
- **Role Selection**: Choose between coach and athlete accounts
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with error messages
- **Demo Credentials**: Pre-populated test accounts for easy testing

### 3. Role-Based Components

#### CoachDashboard.tsx
- **Athlete Roster**: Grid layout with athlete cards
- **Session Management**: List view of all athlete sessions
- **Search Functionality**: Filter athletes and sessions
- **Statistics Cards**: Key metrics overview

#### AthleteDashboard.tsx
- **Personal Sessions**: Detailed view of own training sessions
- **Performance Metrics**: Event-by-event performance tracking
- **Coach Feedback**: Dedicated section for coach notes
- **Analytics View**: Performance trends and comparisons

### 4. Navigation & Sidebar
- **Role-Aware Navigation**: Different menu items for coaches vs athletes
- **User Information**: Display user details in sidebar
- **Access Control**: Hide coach-only features from athletes

## Demo Credentials

### Coach Account
- **Email**: coach@example.com
- **Password**: coach123
- **Features**: Full access to athlete management, all sessions, upload tools

### Athlete Account
- **Email**: athlete@example.com
- **Password**: athlete123
- **Features**: Personal dashboard, own sessions, performance tracking

## Security Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- **Component-Level Protection**: Different dashboards based on user role
- **Feature Gating**: Coach-only features hidden from athletes
- **Navigation Control**: Role-specific menu items

### 2. Session Management
- **Persistent Login**: Maintains authentication state across browser sessions
- **Secure Logout**: Clears all authentication data
- **Loading States**: Prevents unauthorized access during authentication

### 3. Form Security
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for all forms
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Password Confirmation**: Signup requires password confirmation

## User Experience Features

### 1. Responsive Design
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion for transitions

### 2. Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels
- **High Contrast**: Clear visual hierarchy

### 3. Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load as needed
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient re-renders
- **Caching**: localStorage for session persistence
